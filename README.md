	Overview
	  The goal of School Insights is to create a public view of current, holistic, school-level data for each of the 160 schools in the district. Prior to the launch of School Insights, access to information was solely provisioned to school and district leaders. With School Insights, the public now has open access to consistent, key information. School Insights allows stakeholders to use information to for school improvement, school choice, grant seeking, and community organizing. School Insights had over 20,000 users between April 2021 and December 2022 who spent, on average, close to 5 minutes on the site. Using replicable, open-source code, School Insights is poised to be used by other local government entities to further democratize access to information about public schools through this stable, affordable solution.
