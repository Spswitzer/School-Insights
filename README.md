	Overview
	 The goal of School Insights is to create a public view of current, holistic data for each of the 160 schools in the Jefferson County Colorado Public School District. Prior to the launch of School Insights, access to information was solely provisioned to school and district leaders. With School Insights, the public now has broad access to consistent, key information. School Insights allows stakeholders to use information for improvement planning, school choice, grant seeking, and community organizing. School Insights provides 100,000+ data points to over 20,000 users since launching in April 2021. Using replicable and open-source code, School Insights is poised to be used by other local government entities to further democratize access to information through this stable, affordable solution.
